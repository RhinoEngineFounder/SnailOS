Hello. This is the official SnailOS. A very simple Operating system, with no mutlitasking, gui or internet. Just a terminal with preinstalled software.

To compile/assemble and run it on an emulator, just follow this instructions:
    Fist, head to the build folder
    Run the build.sh script. If it won't start and you are on linux, just type this in your command line: chmod +x build.sh
    Then run the run.sh script. Again, if it wont start, just execute: chmod +x build.sh

And then you should have get qemu, the emulator opened!
